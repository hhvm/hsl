# Contributing to the Hack Standard Library
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## No Feature Requests

We will not currently accept pull requests or issues to add new features to the
library; when this library is no longer an experimental preview, we will revisit
this, but expect to continue to be extremely conservative about new features.

Other issues/pull requests are very welcome, especially issues reporting
inconsistencies between parts of this library.

## Our Development Process
The source of truth for this library is an internal repository; we continuously
sync changes out to GitHub using
[FBShipIt](https://github.com/facebook/fbshipit), and test/apply pull requests
against the repository after review.

If a pull request passes the public tests but has internal issues, we will not
be able to merge the pull request until the internal issues are fixed; depending
on the scale of the problem, this can take a few weeks.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
